## Bug
- When you start the project or cleaned the cache with `npx hardhat clean`, the typechain generated files are missing. You have to comment out `import â€˜./scripts/tasks` first in `hardhat.config.ts` and run `npx hardhat typechain` first and then uncomment the import statement.
- Cannot verify proxy contract for influencer beacon proxy on bscscan (mainnet and testnet) with code. The same works for rinkeby, so not sure what went wrong
